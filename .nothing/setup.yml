steps: |-
  Get homebrew
  {homebrew_install_command}
  
  Install these packages
  brew install {homebrew_packages}

  Install these casks
  brew cask install {homebrew_casks}

  Some stuff isn't on homebrew: tpm, poetry (don't judge), and vim-plug.

  For tpm, just clone the repo. It's initialized in .tmux.conf.
  {clone_tpm}

  For vim-plug, run this:
  {install_vim_plug}

  For poetry, run
  curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/python-poetry/poetry/master/get-poetry.py | python

  Now, we symlink. Most stuff will link to $HOME, but there are exceptions.

  nvim is the oddball
  {symlink} ./init.vim ~/.config/nvim/init.vim

  zsh is normal
  {symlink} ./.zshrc ~/.zshrc

  If you already have a zshrc_local_after
  {symlink} ./.zshrc_local_after ~/.zshrc_local_after 

  And finally, tmux
  {symlink} ./.tmux.conf ~/.tmux.conf

  fzf, antibody, zsh, antibody, diff-so-fancy, and neovim have some post-install stuff.

  Set zsh as the default shell
  {zsh_post_install}

  For fzf, install some keybindings.
  {brew_post_install} 

  neovim needs a virtual environment.
  {nvim_post_install_make_venv}

  Install the neovim Python package
  {nvim_post_install_add_package}

  Initialize antibody plugins
  {antibody_bundle_command}

  Run the commands through the link for 'optimal' diffs
  {diff_so_fancy_git_commands}

  Do the drag and drop thing for the terminal theme in this directory. Change font as well.

  Sick! This is the last step.
  After this, restart your terminal and pray.
  You might have to run this to suppress warnings about completions
  compaudit | xargs chmod g-w
