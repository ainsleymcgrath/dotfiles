My setup for nvim, tmux, zsh, some packages from homebrew, and other assorted tools.

Powered by [nothing](github.com/ainsleymcgrath/nothing).

## Usage

The process for installing everything is in `sample.yml` under `.nothing/`.

Before you can run it, you need [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-383/) and [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/). Restart your terminal.

Get `nothing-cli`:

```shell
pip install nothing-cli
```

Run the `setup` procedure.

```shell
not do setup
```
